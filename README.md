# ShadowPlayDiscordifier

A simple tool to compress ShadowPlay clips to under 10MB for sharing on Discord.

## Build Instructions

1. Run `build.bat`
   - This will compile and set up the necessary files.

2. Extract the contents of `build.zip` to the directory where your clips are saved
   - Ensure you select the main folder, not the individual clip folders.
     
3. To execute the transcoding process, run `transcode.bat`
   - This will compress the clips for non-nitro Discord users.
